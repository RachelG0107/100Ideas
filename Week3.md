1. List of BBS
- CBBS, allowed personal-computer owners with modems to dial-in to a dedicated system and leave messages that others would see later, when they, in turn, dialed up the BBS. (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/)
- “Octopus’s Garden,” “Southern Pride,” and “Online's Place.”(https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/)
-The Keep BBS

2. The Internet Archive, oocities, reocities, and geocities.ws opposed this deletion and archived as many websites as possible before October 27, 2009. (https://responsejournal.net/issue/2016-11/article/ruins-geocities) And I found this webstie: https://blog.archive.org/2009/08/25/geocities-preserved/ which says "GeoCities, Preserved!". They have a speical collection page that people can ensure the sites preservation.
"The Internet Archive launched special several deep collection crawls, including specific sites nominated by the public, over the last few months that GeoCities was in operation, to help make our archive of GeoCities sites as deep and thorough as possible."(https://archive.org/web/geocities.php)
