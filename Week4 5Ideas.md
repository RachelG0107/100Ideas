1.3D Printing
	I want to explore how did 3D printing start, and how and why it is now used in different fields, like art, fashion, different industries… Also, why did 3D printing become so popular. How has it changed over time, and how has people’s view on 3D printing changed. 

2.Self-Driving Car/ Electric Car
	I would like to research on either one of them. It is one of the most recent discussed technology now a days. How does each work differently for different counties, based on the different traffic situation? 

3.The development of WeChat
	WeChat is one of the most common used social media apps in China. Its development is ongoing. I want to research on how this app develops to this extent, and its meaning to its users. 

4.Evolving social media in China
	China is having its own social media system, with its own version of different apps. Like its own searching engine, video platform, and different kind of social medias. I want to research on how this ‘system’ developed over time and compare it to the foreign social medias. 

5.Virtual Reality 
	How VR is being used in different medias. How can technology be used in meaningful ways. I saw a news currently, that on company used VR as the technology to recreate a woman’s daughter who already passed away, and showed to the mother, and interacted with her.
